# Signature Verification System using Artificial Intelligence

This is a simple signature verification system that utilizes artificial intelligence techniques to verify the authenticity of signatures. The system allows users to upload both a genuine signature and a potentially forged signature. The AI model then calculates the similarity between the two signatures and determines the genuineness of the provided signatures.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the signature verification system on your local machine:

### Step 1: Set Up Environment

1. Create a virtual environment on your system. Run the following commands in your terminal:

   For Windows:
   ```sh
   python -m venv env
   env\Scripts\activate
   ```
# Alternatively if you can download anaconda navigator and install the following packages
# Steps:
1. download anaconda navigator for your operating system
2. create a virtual environment and select the python version you will like to work with
3. download or clone this project and open it in vscode 
4. launch your terminal and type the following commands:
# Installing dependencies

conda install -c conda-forge face_recognition done
conda install pandas done
conda install streamlit
conda install -c conda-forge opencv done
conda install -c conda-forge imageio
conda install -c conda-forge scikit-image




   For macOS and Linux:
   ```sh
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

1. Install required Python packages. In your terminal, run:
   ```sh
   pip install Flask imageio scikit-image
   ```

### Step 3: Clone the Repository

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using git or download the ZIP file and extract it.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/signature-verification-system.git
   cd signature-verification-system
   ```

### Step 4: Run the Application

1. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project folder.

2. Run the Flask application:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

3. Access the application by opening your web browser and going to http://localhost:5000.

## Usage

1. Home Page: The home page welcomes users to the signature verification system.

2. Signature Verification: Navigate to http://localhost:5000/verification to access the signature verification page. You can upload both the genuine signature and the potentially forged signature. The AI model will calculate the similarity between the signatures and display the level of genuineness.

## AI Model

The AI model used in this system is a simplified version for demonstration purposes. For a production environment, a more advanced machine learning model specialized in signature verification should be used.

## Packages Used

The following Python packages are used in this project:

- Flask: A lightweight web framework for Python to create web applications.
- imageio: A library to read and write various image data formats.
- scikit-image: A collection of algorithms for image processing.

You can install these packages using pip as shown in the installation steps.

Please note that this is a basic implementation of a signature verification system and should be enhanced for real-world applications, including robust AI models, data privacy considerations, and user experience improvements.
